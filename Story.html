        The Mekong Delta in the southwestern region of Vietnam is a vast maze of rivers. 
        Life in the area revolves around water. 
        The Delta has either a hot or rainy climate all year round. 
        Like many of the local children, seven-year-old Phuong loved playing in the water and rain.
        She lived with her family in a house near the big river. 
        One day, something happened that made water the greatest fear in her life. 
    </p>
    
    <p style= "color:darksalmon; text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
        The river nearest to Phuong's house merged into the larger waterway, making the middle of the river much deeper. 
        Thus, the current was much faster and more dangerous. 
        Phuong had a two-year-old brother Tuan who was also loved playing in the water. 
        One morning, while Phuong was helping her mother prepare lunch. 
        Her mother asked, "Where is Tuan?" Phuong ran to the living room to check, but Tuan wasn't there. 
        "Did you see Tuan?" asked Phuong. "No, I did not." Answered her dad. 
        Without a word, each member rushed out of the house in different directions to search for Tuan.
    </p>
    
    <p style= "color:darksalmon;text-indent: 50px;text-align: left; text-indent: 50px;">
        Phuong rushed out on a small path that led to the river. 
        Suddenly, her gaze focused on something unusual on the riverbank.
        To Phuong's horror, there were Tuan's clothes.
        Phuong turned her eyes toward the river and saw a terrifying image. 
        Tuan was struggling face down in the water.
        "Mom! I found him!" Phuong shouted and jumped into the deep river to save Tuan, forgetting that she didn't know how to swim.  
        The love she had for her little brother was much greater than the fear of the deep water.
    </p>
    <p style= "color:salmon;text-indent:50px; text-align: left;">
        A neighbor from across the river heard Phuong's voice. 
        He swam to get Tuan out of the water, but Phuong was nowhere to be seen. 
        The next few moments were the longest in her life. 
        She struggled to get to the surface but was too little for the deep river and too weak in the moving current. 
        She kicked and clawed desperately in the watery grave, but the current kept pushing her down as if it were trying to swallow her whole. 

    </p>
    <p style= "color:darksalmon; text-indent: 50px;text-align: left;">
        Phuong's mother was screaming so loudly that neighbors near and far heard her cries and came running. 
        The neighbors searched the dark red-brown water, which was impossible to see through. 
        Finally, a man shouted: "I got her!" He carried Phuong's lifeless body out of the water.
        </p>
    <p style= "color:darksalmon;text-indent: 50px; text-align: left;">
        Phuong's face was pale, her lips were blue, and her skin was as cold as ice.
        No pain could compare to that of a mother watching her child die. 
        The witnesses to the apparent tragedy said nothing as they listened to the screams of Phuong's mother. 
        After many failed efforts to revive Phuong, they gave up in despair. The hospital was too far away.  
        People backed up, making way for her dad to take her inside.
        He laid her on the day bed.  The neighbors dressed her in dry clothes and dried her hair. 
        They helped gather things for the impending ceremony.
        </p>
    <p style= "color:darksalmon;text-indent: 50px;text-align: left;">
        Several hours later, however, an impossible thing happened. 
        Phuong sat up and looked at everyone. 
        Phuong's mother instantly came over, sat next to her, and held her hand with a smile while tears were streaming down her cheeks.
        "Where is Tuan?" asked Phuong. Her mother turned and looked straight across the living room. 
        There was Tuan.  He was running around with a happy and innocent face as nothing had happened. 
        A smile slowly spread across Phuong's face.  
        At that moment, the only thing in her mind was the well-being of her little brother. 
    </p>
    <p style= "color:darksalmon;text-indent: 50px;text-align:left;">
        The near-drowning experience was engraved in Phuong's mind and permanently changed the way she looks at water. 
        Every time she is near a river or pond, the terrifying image of Tuan lying face down in the water, along with the fear of fighting for her life in that river replays in her head.  
        Still, she doesn't regret her actions.  Though Phuong loved playing in the water, she learned that it could also be a potential for great danger, especially to children.   
        Deep down inside, Phuong is grateful and appreciates that she survived the near drowning. 
        She also takes it as a powerful life lesson that she will never take life for granted.
