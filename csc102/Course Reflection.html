        CSC102 is a beginning programming course. 
        The course introduces students to basic techniques and concepts of JavaScrip, CSS, and HTML. 
        The course objectives require students to understand essential algorithm elements such as variables, functions, and how to write simple codes. 
    </p>
    <p style= "text-align: left; text-indent: 45px;">
        Students have learned step-by-step basic programming, problem-solving methods, including functions and variables, and understanding and using multiple tags in HTML throughout the course.  
        Additionally, students also learned to link external CSS/JS files into HTML or embedded CSS/ script tags in HTML. 
        Moreover, students also learned how to debug their codes as well as launch a website.

        As a student of this course, I’ve learned how to write simple codes, analyze, and look for root causes of errors in my codes.
        Before starting the course, I was an absolute beginner in programming, which means I hadn’t written a code.
        However, after the five weeks course, I have gained so much knowledge and skills in coding. 
        Since I had no prior knowledge of programming, I’ve spent most of my time everyday reading, practicing, watching tutorial videos, and referencing materials from different sources outside of the class materials. 
        Because I am determined to learn, I’ve mastered almost all the course objectives (I need to learn how to implement functions successfully in less time). 
        In addition, I’ve also learned so much about programming from outside of the class, such as animation properties. 
    </p>
    <p style= "text-align: left; text-indent: 45px;">
    Overall, I enjoyed the course and feel proud of my accomplishment.
    Thank you, Dr. Coddington, for being such a wonderful professor who has a passion for teaching, helping students succeed, and is willing to assist.
