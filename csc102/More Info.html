    The Western region in Vietnam is known as the Nine Dragon River Delta, literally or the Mekong Delta River.
    Life in the Mekong Delta revolves very much around them.   
    The equatorial monsoon climate regime produces high temperatures all year round and heavy rainfall.
    Years ago, the local children enjoyed playing in the water and rain.  
    Seven-year-old Phuong lived with her family and a two-year-old brother named Tuan. 
    They both loved playing in the water.
    One day, something happened to little Tuan that would haunt Phuong and make water the source of great fear for the rest of her life.
    </p>
    <p style= "text-indent: 45px;color:rosybrown">
    In a hot, typical morning, Phuong and her family suddenly noticed that Tuan wasn’t in the house.
    Everyone rushed out to find him in different directions. Phuong ran out on a small path that led to a big river.
    She saw something on the riverbank and immediately ran towards it. 
    To Phuong’s horror, they were Tuan’s clothes. Instantly, Phuong’s eyes turned into the water.
    There was a frightening image that she would never forget. 
    Tuan was struggling in the water face down. 
    Without thinking, Phuong jumped into the big deep river to save Tuan, forgetting that she didn’t know how to swim…
